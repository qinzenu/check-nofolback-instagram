# Instagram Followers Checker

A lightweight, privacy-focused web application that analyzes Instagram exported data to identify accounts that do not follow you back.

Built with pure HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript.
No backend. No tracking. No data storage.

---

## Overview

Instagram Followers Checker allows users to upload their official Instagram data export (JSON format) and instantly compare followers vs following directly in the browser.

All processing happens client-side, ensuring maximum privacy and security.

## Key Features

* Dual Mode Interface

  * Smartphone Mode (Manual Upload)
  * Desktop Mode (Drag & Drop)

* Modern Dark UI Design

* Animated Notification System

* Interactive Guide Modal

* Fully Client-Side Processing

* No External Database

## How It Works

1. User downloads Instagram data in JSON format.
2. The application reads:

   * `followers_1.json`
   * `following.json`
3. The script extracts:

   * Followers list
   * Following list
4. It compares both arrays.
5. Displays accounts that do not follow back.

All comparisons are executed using native JavaScript array methods.
